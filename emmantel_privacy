  <h1>Privacy Policy – emmantel</h1>
  <p>Last updated: September 2025</p>

  <p>
    Emmantel (“we”, “our”, or “us”) values your privacy. 
    This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled in relation 
    to the application connected to Pinterest’s API.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Purpose of the App</h2>
  <p>
    This app has been created for private, personal use only. 
    Its sole function is to generate images and captions and 
    publish them to Pinterest via the official Pinterest API.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    We do not collect, store, or share personal information. 
    The app does not track user behavior or process data beyond 
    what is required to authenticate with Pinterest.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Authentication</h2>
  <p>
    The app uses Pinterest’s secure OAuth2 authentication system. 
    Any access tokens are used solely to allow the app to publish 
    pins to the authorized Pinterest account.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer personal information 
    to outside parties. No data is shared with third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>
    Because the app is for private use only, data access is limited 
    to the creator. Reasonable steps are taken to protect the 
    authentication information associated with the Pinterest account.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes 
    will be reflected on this page with a new “last updated” date.
